# CV App Creator

This is a React application to create a simple CV by filling out the form. I used html2pdf.js to save the preview as a PDF.

The app is live on Cloudflare.

[You can try the app by clicking here.](https://cv-app-creator.pages.dev/)

## Description

While filling out the form, you can see a live preview generated as you type.

You can then save it as a PDF.

(Note: The pdf will look different to the preview as some stylings are not transferred to the PDF)

## Releases
